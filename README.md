Data and code for Normal Mixed Modeling of phenotypic divergence in Unicolored Jays. Analyses incorporated into the forthcoming manuscript "Cloudy with a chance of speciation: evolutionary history and integrative taxonomy of Unicolored Jays (Aphelocoma unicolor) in Mesoamerican cloud forest".

The three separate scripts utilize the same normal mixed modeling technique from:
Carlos Daniel Cadena, Felipe Zapata, Iván Jiménez; Issues and Perspectives in Species Delimitation using Phenotypic Data: Atlantean Evolution in Darwin’s Finches, Systematic Biology, Volume 67, Issue 2, 1 March 2018, Pages 181–194, https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syx071

The three scripts analyze all five subspecies together, and then separate the major lineages on each side (East and West) of the isthmus of Tehuantepec. For the manuscript, analyses were separated across the isthmus to account for the major genetic break, and the possible convergent evolution of plumage hues between geographically and genetically isolated subspecies.
